# AWShorts (AWS Shorts) YouTube Series

# Overview
AWShorts is a YouTube series where I explore different AWS services (primarily around containers) through practical projects I want to work on, each episode running 10 minutes or under. The goal is to learn and demostrate my AWS knowledge rather than it being a lesson or tutorial. Each episode is 10 minutes or less.

this GitHub repository contains the code, configurations and notes for each episode of the *AWShorts* YouTube series I worked on.  

Each episode folder will include all the files I used during the episode such as the workflow, code, steps etc. 

The goal is to release an episode every week or second week on my YouTube channel
